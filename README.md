# Neo Docs

Neo Docs is a bunch of tutorials to help get going with the N3 Neo Blockchain. 

Programming on Neo is really powerful. The tools are excellent, and hopefully now there are some docs too to get started!

## Collaboration

These docs are community written, so please open Pull Requests to make changes and add anything

#### Code Snippets

The goal is to have everything that you would want to do on Neo, in as many languages as we can get. To add a code snippet you will see

<pre>
{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Go" %}}
```go
//go code here
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Python" %}}
```python
// python code here
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="C#" %}}
```c#
// c# code here
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}
</pre>
Feel free to copy the same structure to add other languages.

## Running the documentation

The docs are written with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - to run locally install Hugo and run
