## Neo Community Documentation

Currently this is very much a work in progress, however I hope that with time this documentation will help developers realise the immense apps that they can build on top of Neo.

Please join us on the Neo discord server if you would like any support and please contribute back if you have something to add!

With time there will be an easy to use 'get things done' API for Go, and a starter app for Javascript developers to build on top of.

Best place to get started is probably in the [overview](/neo-docs/introduction/overview) area, or if you want to get cracking, head over the [creating a wallet!](/neo-docs/tutorials/wallets)
