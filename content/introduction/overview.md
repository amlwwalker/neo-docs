###  Concepts

This chapter outlines the [concepts](/neo-docs/introduction/concepts) and top level points required to understand and enjoy building on neo & NeoFS

### Starting out

You will need:

1. Go language installed and running
2. Clone, or `go get` the libraries outlined below. Confirm you can import them into a project
3. Read the [wallets](/neo-docs/tutorials/wallets/) page as it will outline the basis of working with Neo and NeoFS - a wallet. 
4. Neo/Gas in your wallet. You can get these from the [testnet faucet here](https://neowish.ngd.network/#/)
5. These libraries will assume you are using the testnet throughout. All urls referenced can be retrieved from NeoFS or from Dora the explorer.

### Libraries

[Libraries](/neo-docs/introduction/libraries) covers the packages and libraries that are required to interact with Neo and NeoFS in Go
