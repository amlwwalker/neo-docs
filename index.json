Listing is a special case of searching within a container. To search for specific objects, you add filters to the search. By setting the only filter as a root filter, it will list everything within the container Go Python C#  var searchParams = new (client.SearchObjectParams) var filters = object.SearchFilters{} filters.AddRootFilter() searchParams.WithContainerID(containerID) searchParams.WithSearchFilters(filters) res, err := cli.SearchObjects(ctx, searchParams, client.WithSession(sessionToken)) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;list objects %+v\\n\u0026#34;, res.IDList())   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     Retrieve an Object Once you have the ID of an object, you can download it.\nYou will need\n an io.Writer to write the data to a file such as a file writer an object address, which is made up of a container ID and an object ID  To generate an object address from the string forms of a containerID and an objectID: Go Python C#  contID := cid.New() contID.Parse(containerID) objID := obj.NewID() objID.Parse(objectID) objAddress := obj.NewAddress() objAddress.SetObjectID(objID) objAddress.SetContainerID(contID)   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     so now you can retrieve the object Go Python C#  var getParams = new(client.GetObjectParams) getParams.WithAddress(objectAddress) getParams.WithPayloadWriter(*writer) o, err := cli.GetObject(ctx, getParams, client.WithSession(sessionToken)) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(err) } // payload is in bytes []bytes payload := o.Object().Payload() }   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     Retrieving an objects HEAD/metadata Sometimes you want information about an object, without actually downloading the entire object, for instance the size of an object\nFrom a container, you can find out storage policies, owners and any other meta information about the container itself. This is very similar to retrieving the object\nGo Python C#  var headParams = new(client.ObjectHeaderParams) headParams.WithAddress(objectAddress) headObject, err := cli.HeadObject(ctx, headParams, client.WithSession(sessionToken)) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(err) } size := headObject.Object().PayloadSize()   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     Deleting Objects You may wish to delete an object for a container\nGo Python C#  var deleteParams = new (client.DeleteObjectParams) deleteParams.WithAddress(objectAddress) _, err := cli.DeleteObject(ctx, deleteParams, client.WithSession(sessionToken)) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(err) }   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     Questions about objects  Can you update the attributes of an existing object Can you determine the original uploader of an object  "},{"uri":"https://neo-docs.onrender.com/tutorials/tokens/","title":"Tokens","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Tokens are requried to act on any objects within a container. Sessions last for limited time and are restricted by permissions. Session tokens use the private key to sign them while bearer tokens are issued to wallets by a container owner.\nSession Tokens Session tokens are tokens that are generated from your private key and are required to access or interact with content inside a container.

The owner is the most privileged account with regards to a container so a session key should never be shared.\nBearer Tokens Bearer tokens allow the account that owns the container, to issue limited time access tokens to other accounts. Bearer tokens require rules to be applied to grant access and to deny access to anyone else. Read more about EACL Tables to get a better understanding of what they are\nOnce an account has a bearer token it can pass the token along with any request to the container as it does a Session Token.\nYou will need\n A NeoFS client A context (context.Background is fine in most cicumstances) When you want the bearer token to expire, in epochs.

This is because the client functions are expecting a variable length input, so just providing a Session Token is fine, you can also provide nil as the Bearer Token if you prefer\n"},{"uri":"https://neo-docs.onrender.com/tutorials/acl-permissions/","title":"ACL Permissions","tags":[],"description":"","content":"NeoFS has an awesome set of permissions you can give to containers.\nACL stands for access control list - its a list, or table really, of rules. They are checked top to bottom to any incoming request. The first permission entry in the table that the request passes, will end the checks. To that end it is important that all DENY permissions come after any ALLOW permissions.\nTypes of permission  Basic ACL Permisisons  These can only be applied to containers. They are the top most priority in terms of permissions, they cannot be changed, and they cannot be overruled. If the basic permissions of a container says that no one can read from the container, then no further permission can overrule this.   Extended ACL Permissions  These can be applied to a container at any time and can \u0026ldquo;extend\u0026rdquo; the permissions. For instance, you may have a container that is private, however you may want to give a specific wallet access to the container. Like a shared container (except the container owner pays for the container). These however, can also be given temporarily, instead of changing the permissions on the container as a whole. This way the permissions can be allowed to expire and remove any privileges that they offered. To do this, a Bearer Token is issued, and sent to the wallet that should gain these new access rights.    Basic ACL Permissions When creating a container, you are going to need to create a permission. There are multiple preset permissions you can see in the table further down\nGo Python C#  permissions := acl.EACLReadOnlyBasicRule   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     You can read more about ACL permissions within the NeoFS documentation however a set of available to use permissions are available. Most languages with an SDK will have constants set to these values\n In the following table, names that start with EACL (e.g EACLPrivateBasicRule) allow for extended policies to be used in conjunction with the basic ACL permissions\n    Name Value Description     PublicBasicRule 0x1FBFBFFF PublicBasicRule is a basic ACL value for final public-read-write container for which extended ACL CANNOT be set.   PrivateBasicRule 0x1C8C8CCC PrivateBasicRule is a basic ACL value for final private container for which extended ACL CANNOT be set.   ReadOnlyBasicRule 0x1FBF8CFF ReadOnlyBasicRule is a basic ACL value for final public-read container for which extended ACL CANNOT be set.   PublicAppendRule 0x1FBF9FFF PublicAppendRule is a basic ACL value for final public-append container for which extended ACL CANNOT be set.   EACLPublicBasicRule 0x0FBFBFFF EACLPublicBasicRule is a basic ACL value for non-final public-read-write container for which extended ACL CAN be set.   EACLPrivateBasicRule 0x0C8C8CCC EACLPrivateBasicRule is a basic ACL value for non-final private container for which extended ACL CAN be set.   EACLReadOnlyBasicRule 0x0FBF8CFF EACLReadOnlyBasicRule is a basic ACL value for non-final public-read container for which extended ACL CAN be set.   EACLPublicAppendRule 0x0FBF9FFF EACLPublicAppendRule is a basic ACL value for non-final public-append container for which extended ACL CAN be set.    Nice to Know: the ability for a basic ACL permission to allow for Extended ACL permissions is controlled by the highest \u0026lsquo;bit\u0026rsquo; in the above value. So comparing two of the above and comparing them in binary form\n   Name Value Binary     PublicBasicRule 0x1FBFBFFF 00011111101111111011111111111111   PrivateBasicRule 0x1C8C8CCC 00011100100011001000110011001100   EACLPublicAppendRule 0x0FBF9FFF 00001111101111111001111111111111    we can see here that the top two start 0001 however the final one starts 0000. When this is a 1, only BASIC ACL is processed.\nWhats important is that if Basic ACL denies access, then Extended ACL cannot overrule.\n Extended ACL Extended ACL permissions, are rules that can be applied over and beyond a container\u0026rsquo;s basic ACL permissions.\nThis is fantastically powerful as it allows a container owner to specify very strict and very specific rules to allow an account, or group of accounts to access certain objects within the container based on these extended rules.\nDue to the capabilities of Extended ACL, there are a few concepts to understand\nFour Concepts When thinking about these concepts, remember,\nWe are creating a rule for when an actor attempts to make a request to our container. These concepts are what make up that request\n Operation  The operation is a check against the type of request being made, e.g PUT, GET, HEAD, DELETE, SEARCH, RANGE, and RANGEHASH against the container   Target  The target (or targets) are the accounts making the requests to our container in the first place. Using targets, we can specify different groups of accounts that this rule should apply to. There are four ways to refer to groups of accounts.  user this is the container owner others this refers to everyone else system this refers to nodes on the NeoFS network. It\u0026rsquo;s less likely you will use this target Or a specific public key of an account   For each type of target, you can specify whether you want it to be included in the rule   Filters  Where these ACL rules can get really powerful is when they are combined with object attributes. Once you have read about object attributes you will know that when an object is uploaded to a container, attributes can be attached to it. These attributes can be searched/filtered as part of building up an ACL rule   Action  And finally the whole point of the rule in the first place - the action decides what the rule, if a match is made, either to ALLOW or DENY the request    Once you have this, the rule, containing these four parts, (which actually is a record) is added to an EACL table.\nImplementation We are going to create an Extended ACL rule that\n denys \u0026lsquo;any one else\u0026rsquo;, i.e all accounts that we don\u0026rsquo;t otherwise specify allows a specific account (public key) read access to the objects Requires the object to have an attribute LetMeIn:OK  Note, there are multiple types of attribute filter you can apply, such as filtering by object length (AddObjectPayloadLengthFilter) or filter by owner of the object (AddObjectOwnerIDFilter). Check the eacl package for functions that add filters to records Firstly we need two records. One for the others and one for our privileged key\nimport \u0026#34;github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-sdk-go/eacl\u0026#34; othersRecord := eacl.NewRecord() privRecord := eacl.NewRecord() Operation Quite simple, set both records to apply to GET requests\nothersRecord.SetOperation(eacl.OperationGet) privRecord.SetOperation(eacl.OperationGet) Targets First we create a group that applies to the others target group - the rule that will block anyone we don\u0026rsquo;t want accessing our container. Then add it to the record\nothersTarget := eacl.NewTarget() othersTarget.SetRole(eacl.RoleOthers) // set the role to \u0026#39;others`  now create a target for a specific public key\n// demo public key - 33-byte hex encoded public key from N3 wallet const pubKeyStr = \u0026#34;03ab362a4eda62d22505ffe5a5e5422f1322317e8088afedb7c5029801e1ece806\u0026#34; pub := keys.NewPublicKeyFromString(pubKeyStr) privTarget := eacl.NewTarget() eacl.SetTargetECDSAKeys(privTarget, pub) Now we can add our targets to our record\nothersRecord.SetTargets(othersTarget) privRecord.SetTargets(privTarget) Filters Now we can use search capabilities against attributes on objects to filter even more specifically. In this case we are going to check that the object matches a specifc key, value pair\nothersRecord.AddObjectAttributeFilter(eacl.MatchStringEqual, \u0026#34;LetMeIn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;) privRecord.AddObjectAttributeFilter(eacl.MatchStringEqual, \u0026#34;LetMeIn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;) Now both records state that for anyone, even the privileged key, to GET a file, the attribute match.\nAction Now we specify what each record should do if any part of the rule matches. The first match will result in that request being allowed or denied depending on what record matched\nothersRecord.SetAction(eacl.ActionDeny) privRecord.SetAction(eacl.ActionAllow) EACL Table To use these records now, they need to go into a table that references the container that they should be applied to\nRemember to add the records ALLOW followed by DENY otherise all requests will match the first record (DENY) and no account will be able to access the container\n table := eacl.NewTable() table.SetCID(someContainerID) table.AddRecord(privRecord) table.AddRecord(othersRecord) Notes  Container EACL can have a latest version (an update) but cannot be altered in anyway. A new table must be created superseding the previous It may seem that the DENY rules in this case are redundant or that the default would result in the others group being blocked automatically. On the other hand it may seem just to easy to miss a rule and accidentally let an acount through.  You can read more about EACL rule ordering and execution here in the NeoFS spec however a high level overview:\nSetting the EACL Container The first thing you can do is specify this against the whole container. This maybe something you would do if you were wanting to share the container\u0026rsquo;s contents with someone.\nYou will need\n a NeoFS client  _, err = cli.SetEACL(ctx, table) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;can\u0026#39;t set extended ACL: %w\u0026#34;, err) } at this point setting the EACL against the container can take some time. Waiting is necessary to get a response.\nfor i := 0; i \u0026lt;= 30; i++ { if i == 30 { log.Fatal(\u0026#34;timeout, extended ACL was not persisted in side chain\u0026#34;) } time.Sleep(time.Second) _, err := cli.EACL(ctx, someContainerID) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;error setting eacl: %w\u0026#34;, err) } } Of course this can be handled better with channels\nBearer Token There is more on Bearer Tokens here, however you can add these Extended ACL rules to them so that the account that is issued with the token, can access objects within the container based on the Extended ACL rules.\nTo create a bearer token, you will need the private key of the container owner (containerOwnerKey).\nThis is further explained in Bearer Tokens\nbtoken := new(token.BearerToken) btoken.SetOwner(tokenReceiverID) btoken.SetLifetime(100, 10, 1) // exp, nbf, iat arguments just like in JWT tokens. You can calculate the expiry using the current epoch and a number of epochs into the future btoken.SetEACLTable(table) //table from earlier  err := btoken.SignToken(containerOwnerKey) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;error signing token: %w\u0026#34;, err) } tokenBytes, err := btoken.MarshalJSON() if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;error marshaling token: %w\u0026#34;, err) } You can then issue the tokenBytes to whichever account should have it. See Bearer Tokens for more information\n"},{"uri":"https://neo-docs.onrender.com/tutorials/clients/","title":"Clients","tags":[],"description":"","content":"There are two types of client to be aware, of and as they are both clients, it can be confusing.

All nodes have attributes that can be used to filter their capabilities and whether they meet the requirements for the policy.\nA filter can check for instance if a node is situated in Europe, and the data would be stored on SSDs (solid state drives).\nA filter contains\n A Key  The name of the attribute to filter   A value  The value to compare the attribute with   An operation  The way in which to make the comparison (less than, greater then, equal to etc) There are 8 filters:  EQ equal to NE not equal to GE greater than or equal to GT greater than LT less than LE less than or equal to OR or AND and      A filter could therefore be\n Country = Italy Rating \u0026gt; 3.5  Filters can also have names so they can be grouped into \u0026lsquo;meanings\u0026rsquo;, for instance\nCountry = Finland OR Country = Iceland AS ColdCountry Now you can refer to Finland and Iceland as ColdCountry in further/more complex filters such as\nFILTER Country EQ \u0026#34;Finland\u0026#34; OR \u0026#34;Iceland\u0026#34; AS ColdCountry FILTER ColdCountry AND StorageType = SSD AND Price \u0026lt; 100 FILTER SSD EQ true AS IsSSD FILTER @IsSSD AND Country EQ \u0026#34;RU\u0026#34; AND City EQ \u0026#34;St.Petersburg\u0026#34; AS SPBSSD FILTER \u0026#39;Continent\u0026#39; EQ \u0026#39;North America\u0026#39; OR Continent EQ \u0026#39;South America\u0026#39; AS Americas Note country codes come from the open flight database. NeoFS uses the code found here to manage these codes\nSelectors Once a filter has found some nodes that adhere to the requirements, selectors can now be specified to decide which nodes end up in the container policy.\nSelectors are slightly easier to understand as part of examples, but the principles of selectors are outlined here\nA selector contains\n A name  a name that can be referred to   An Attribute  the name of the attribute that will be used to group nodes together. The nodes will be grouped into buckets based on the value of the attribute, or you however create \u0026lsquo;random\u0026rsquo; groups of nodes.   The count  The number of nodes that should be included in a bucket   A Clause  The clause specifies how to interpret the count e.g  SAME - choose nodes that are part of the same bucket DISTINCT - choose nodes that are from distinct buckets      Select + Filter Its easiest to understand a placement policy when considering this combination defines minimal suitable container. FILTER specifies a subset of suitable nodes and SELECT picks exact nodes from this subset. If network map does not have enough nodes for a minimal suitable container, an error will be produced.\nSome examples of SELECT + FILTER\nThis one is simpler, select 6 nodes from any location.\nSELECT 6 FROM * This example states the policy should select a single node that is located in St Petersburg, Russia\nSELECT 1 FROM SPB FILTER Country EQ \u0026quot;RU\u0026quot; AND City EQ \u0026quot;St.Petersburg\u0026quot; AS SPB (note this isn\u0026rsquo;t strictly accurate but works for the example - read about Container Backup Factors)\nReplicas Replicas define how many copies of objects should be stored within a Replica. A replica is a group of nodes where a single copy of an object is stored.\nWith replicas you can decide how much redundancy you would like when it comes to a container\u0026rsquo;s contents and making sure that the data isn\u0026rsquo;t lost\nContainer backup Factor (CBF) The container backup factor defines the maximum number of nodes that should be included within a container\u0026rsquo;s set of nodes.\nYou could have a placement policy that specifies there should be 10 nodes within 2 countries with a Container Backup Factor of 2.\nIn this case the CBF will attempt to have 20 nodes in 2 countries, but anything from 10-20 is good and better, but not a failure.\nNote, although we have outlined CBF as a concept last here, it should come second, after REP\nExamples    Placement Policy Description     REP 3 When no select or filter is defined, the default will be just to \u0026ldquo;replicate 3 times selecting from anywhere, i.e REP 3 SELECT 3 FROM * . Note CBF defaults to 3, and still applies here, so replicate from 3-9 nodes if they exist   REP 3 CBF 4 As above, however CBF has been set to 4, so this will select between 3 and 12 nodes to replicate data over   REP 1 IN SPB SELECT 1 IN City FROM * AS SPB 1 replica in every city   REP 2 SELECT 6 FROM * Replicate objects twice, selecting minimum of 6 nodes from anywhere. With CBF it will select up to 18 nodes    When making policies, it should be defined in the order REP, CBF, SELECT, FILTER\nBasic example\nGo Python C#  const placementPolicy = `REP 2 IN X CBF 2 SELECT 2 FROM * AS X `   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     References  Spec https://nspcc.ru/upload/neofs-spec-latest.pdf#a Tests/Examples https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-sdk-go/blob/master/policy/query_test.go JSON format of policies (can help seeing complexity) https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-sdk-go/blob/master/netmap/json_tests/filter_simple.json  "},{"uri":"https://neo-docs.onrender.com/tutorials/wallets/","title":"Wallets","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Almost everything you may want to do with NeoFS will require access to a wallet.

There is a potential minor confusion at this stage. Neo N3 wallets store NEP-17 coins. Both Neo and Gas are NEP 17 currencies, however any currency you or someone else may make could also be a NEP-17 currency. There are other standards such as NEP-11 and the difference I will leave to you to read about.\nHowever, NeoFS has a smart contract in which you need to transfer Gas to, so that you can pay for NeoFS storage space. This balance won\u0026rsquo;t show up in your wallet balance.\nTo retrieve you wallet\u0026rsquo;s NEP-17 balances you will need to create a wallet client.\nYou will need\n A wallet address you want to get the balances of  Go Python C#  cli, err := client.New(ctx, \u0026#34;http://seed1t4.neo.org:20332\u0026#34;, client.Options{}) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;can\u0026#39;t create the client: %w\u0026#34;, err) } err = cli.Init() if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;can\u0026#39;t init the client: %w\u0026#34;, err) } recipient, err := helper.StringToUint160(walletAddress) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;can\u0026#39;t convert the wallet address: %w\u0026#34;, err) } balances, err := cli.GetNEP17Balances(recipient) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;can\u0026#39;t retrieve the balances: %w\u0026#34;, err) } fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;balances %+v\\r\\n\u0026#34;, balances)   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     Transferring NEP-17 tokens A major part of blockchain technology is to be able to transfer tokens to other wallets (including sending GAS to the NeoFS smart contract).\nYou will need\n An unlocked wallet myWallet A wallet to send Nep17 to walletTo The amount you would like to send (as an int64 - no decimals in blockchain remember!) The token you would like to send. To retrieve the token, you need the token name to get the contract hash  Go Python C#  gasToken, err := cli.GetNativeContractHash(nativenames.Gas) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     then\nGo Python C#  ctx := context.Background() // use endpoint addresses of public RPC nodes, e.g. from https://dora.coz.io/monitor cli, err := client.New(ctx, \u0026#34;http://seed1t4.neo.org:20332\u0026#34;, client.Options{}) if err != nil { return util.Uint256{}, err } err = cli.Init() if err != nil { return util.Uint256{}, err } recipient, err := helper.StringToUint160(walletTo) if err != nil { return util.Uint256{}, err } txHash, err := cli.TransferNEP17(myWallet, recipient, gasToken, amount, 0, nil, nil) le := txHash.StringLE() return txHash, err   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     the txHash is reversed in its uint256 state. You need to reverse it so that it matches the txHashes you would find in a blockchain explorer for instance, hence the le := txHash.StringLE()\n NeoFS Balance However this balance as I mentioned, does not include your NeoFS balance. For that you need a NeoFS client\nGo Python C#  import ( \u0026#34;github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-sdk-go/client\u0026#34; )   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     Once you have this, you can now retrieve your NeoFS balance\nYou will need\n Private key NeoFS client (cli)  Go Python C#  w, err := owner.NEO3WalletFromPublicKey(\u0026amp;key.PublicKey) if err != nil { fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;couldn\u0026#39;t create wallet from public key: %w\u0026#34;, err) } id := owner.NewIDFromNeo3Wallet(w) ctx := context.Background() neoFSBalance, err := cli.GetBalance(ctx, id) fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;neofs balance %+v\\r\\n\u0026#34;, neoFSBalance)   print(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;)   Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;please help by opening a Pull Request and filling in these code snippets!\u0026#34;);     "},{"uri":"https://neo-docs.onrender.com/introduction/libraries/","title":"Libraries","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Code Libraries The Go SDK is the basis of all the functionality that is available to you as a developer with regards to NeoFS.\nthe Neo-Go package offers all the functionalities that you will require to interact with the Neo blockchain and wallets\nSDK The SDK is responsible for providing functionality to interact with NeoFS itself via gRPC requests.
